    projectStory: 'A new law firm needs more technology than you\'d think. Email accounts, a website, phone systems, Wi-Fi, printers, computers—all of it had to be set up from nothing. I registered the domain, built the website, and configured Google Workspace so everyone had professional email addresses. I installed mesh routers so there were no dead spots, set up VoIP phones so clients could call, and made sure the printer worked from every device. I wrote documentation so the staff would know how to use everything. By the end, the firm had modern, reliable infrastructure that just worked. The attorneys could practice law instead of troubleshooting tech problems.',

    description: 'Complete API backend rebuild in 2 weeks delivering a 1000% performance improvement for automotive mobile applications. Replaced legacy systems with modern, scalable architecture while automating vendor data integration through Azure Functions. The new system dramatically improved user experience and operational efficiency, demonstrating expertise in performance optimization and cloud-native development. This project showcases the ability to modernize critical business systems while maintaining data integrity and minimizing downtime.',

    projectStory: 'The mobile app was painfully slow. Mechanics in the field would tap a button and wait... and wait... sometimes thirty seconds just to look up a product. The old system was a mess of spaghetti code nobody wanted to touch. I was asked simply to "fix it". I stripped it down to the studs and rebuilt everything with a simple, purpose-built API server. When we deployed, the same queries that took three seconds now took three tenths. A 1000% improvement. The mechanics could actually do their jobs now. Sometimes the best thing you can do is throw out the old and start fresh.',

[Intro]
(Mechanical drill whirring, digital crash. Heavy industrial synth bass starts.)

[Verse]
[V1] Old code hanging like a ghost in the wires,
[V2] Bloated architecture setting tech on fire!
[V1] Mechanics in the bay, hitting "search" then they pray,
[V2] Losing half a minute while the [Both] profit fades away!
[V1] Thirty-second latency, a system out of breath,
[V2] Legacy spaghetti, yeah, it's [Both] coding us to death!
[V1] I told the man "Two weeks," and I saw his spirit sink,
[V2] He's skeptical and desperate, [Both] standing on the brink!
[V1] I stripped it to the studs, pulled the copper from the wall,
[V2] Modern architecture making [Both] giants look small!

[Chorus: Both, Overlapping]
Burn the old house! Leave the ash on the floor!
One thousand percent! Yeah, we coming for more!
Stripped to the studs! Rebuild the machine!
From thirty to three—keep the binary clean!
[V1] Throw out the old!
[V2] Start it fresh!
[Both] Put the ghost in the metal and the spark in the flesh!

[Bridge]
[V1, Heavy] No more waiting on the payload, no more stalling on the line.
[V2, Rapid-fire] Clean API, optimized, everything is fine!
[V1] The mechanics do the job, yeah, the hammers start to swing,
[V2] When the backend is a weapon, [Both] let the victory ring!

[Outro]
(Music cuts abruptly with a sharp digital glitch.)`,

    sunoStyle: `High-energy underground hip-hop. Dual male tag-team vocalists with aggressive, interlocking chemistry. Vocalist 1 (The Heavy): Deep, authoritative, stomping rhythm, weighted flow slightly behind the beat for massive power. Vocalist 2 (The Jagged): High-pitched, overclocked speed, double-time triplets, breathless and sharp with crisp consonants. Production: Abrasive industrial futurism. Distorted analog synths, bit-crushed textures, and experimental glitches over boom-bap foundations with heavy electronic noise. Rhythm: Massive overdriven 808 kicks, sharp snappy snares, and hard-hitting syncopated breakbeats at 80-90 BPM. Atmosphere: Dystopian, defiant, raw, cinematic futuristic heist vibe. Darkly humorous and unapologetically bold.`,

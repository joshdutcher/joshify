  - `npm run lint` command fails due to missing configuration file  
  - Need to run `npm init @eslint/config` or create manual configuration
  - Affects code quality and CI/CD pipeline setup

### Data & Content Issues  
- **Placeholder GitHub URLs**: Replace placeholder URLs with real repository links
  - `beer-fridge-app`: Currently `https://github.com/username/beer-fridge-app`
  - `wichita-radar`: Currently `https://github.com/username/wichita-radar`
  - 7 total projects have `githubUrl: null` that could have real repository links

### Repository Cleanup
- **Canvas Videos in Git**: Videos present in repo despite .gitignore exclusion
  - `public/canvases/*.mp4` files are tracked but should be hosted via GitHub Releases
  - Current videos: `beer-fridge.mp4`, `cz-corp-formation.mp4`, `cz-operations-setup.mp4`
  - Need to remove from git, upload to GitHub Releases, update URLs

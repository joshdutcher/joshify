# TASKS.md - Development Tasks

## üéØ COMPLETED: Canvas Video CDN Migration & Railway Container Fix (September 30, 2025)

**Project Focus**: Canvas video deployment to production and Railway container crash resolution
**Duration**: Single development session
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Canvas Videos on CDN** | ‚úÖ **Railway Container Fixed** | ‚úÖ **Production Deployment Operational**

### ‚úÖ Completed: Canvas Video CDN Migration
**Scope**: Migrated 6 canvas videos (76MB) from local storage to GitHub Releases CDN for production deployment

#### What Was Accomplished
1. **GitHub Releases CDN Setup**: Uploaded canvas videos to v1.0.8 release as CDN assets
   - **Videos**: beer-fridge.mp4 (3MB), did-kansas-win.mp4 (15MB), wichitaradar.mp4 (18MB), mobile-api-rebuild.mp4 (2.5MB), law-firm-startup-operations.mp4 (21MB), startup-technology-infrastructure.mp4 (21MB)
   - **Total Size**: 76MB of video assets hosted externally
   - **Strategy**: Keep git repository lean while enabling production video playback

2. **Project Data Migration**: Updated src/data/projects.ts with CDN URLs
   - **Before**: `canvas: '/canvases/project-name.mp4'` (local paths)
   - **After**: `canvas: 'https://github.com/joshdutcher/joshify/releases/download/v1.0.8/project-name.mp4'` (CDN URLs)
   - **Impact**: Production-ready video hosting with proper fallback chain

3. **CORS Error Handling**: Enhanced smoke tests to handle GitHub CDN limitations (PR #14)
   - **Issue**: GitHub Releases CDN doesn't set CORS headers for cross-origin requests
   - **Solution**: Updated smoke test console error filtering to expect CORS errors as normal behavior
   - **Impact**: Tests pass successfully while properly detecting critical errors

### ‚úÖ Completed: Railway Container Crash Resolution
**Scope**: Fixed Railway container crashes caused by vite attempting to auto-open browser in headless environment

#### What Was Accomplished
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified xdg-open ENOENT error as browser auto-open issue
   - **Error**: `Error: spawn xdg-open ENOENT` causing crash loop
   - **Cause**: Vite's `server.open: true` applying to preview mode in Railway containers
   - **Impact**: Railway deployments failing despite passing all GitHub Actions checks

2. **Failed Fix Attempt (v1.0.10)**: Attempted --host flag solution
   - **Approach**: Added `--host` flag to `npm run preview` in package.json (PR #15)
   - **Rationale**: Believed --host would prevent browser opening behavior
   - **Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Flag only controls network interface exposure, not browser opening
   - **Learning**: --host flag doesn't prevent xdg-open spawn attempts

3. **Successful Fix (v1.0.11)**: Vite configuration modification
   - **Approach**: Added `preview: { open: false }` to vite.config.ts (PR #16)
   - **Rationale**: Directly disable browser opening for preview mode while keeping dev server auto-open
   - **Result**: ‚úÖ Success - Railway container starts successfully without xdg-open
   - **Impact**: Production deployment fully operational

4. **Configuration Strategy**: Separate dev and preview behaviors
   - **Dev Mode**: `server.open: true` - Auto-open browser for local development
   - **Preview Mode**: `preview.open: false` - No browser opening for containerized environments
   - **Benefit**: Maintains developer experience while ensuring production compatibility

#### Technical Achievements
- **Canvas Video Deployment**: 6 projects now have production canvas videos via GitHub CDN
- **Container Compatibility**: Railway deployments work reliably in headless environments
- **Iterative Problem Solving**: v1.0.8 ‚Üí v1.0.9 ‚Üí v1.0.10 ‚Üí v1.0.11 debugging progression
- **Production Stability**: CI/CD pipeline and Railway deployment fully operational

## üéØ COMPLETED: Production CI/CD Pipeline & Railway Deployment (September 28, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed: TypeScript Compilation Error Resolution
**Scope**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors preventing Railway deployment (30+ ‚Üí 0 errors)

#### What Was Accomplished
1. **Union Type Assertions**: Fixed type casting issues in HorizontalCardSection.tsx and MediaCard.tsx
   - **Before**: TypeScript couldn't handle `Project | Playlist` union types passed to specific components
   - **After**: Added explicit type assertions (`item as Playlist`, `item as Project`)
   - **Impact**: Strict TypeScript compilation now passes for Railway deployment

2. **Undefined Parameter Handling**: Resolved `createAnimatedGradient` function errors in ProjectCanvas.tsx
   - **Before**: Function couldn't handle undefined colors array parameter
   - **After**: Updated signature to `colors: string[] | undefined` with fallback logic
   - **Impact**: Robust gradient generation with proper error handling

3. **Missing Enum Properties**: Added missing `ANDROID_DEVELOPMENT` to Skill enum in types/index.ts
   - **Before**: Enum reference existed but property was missing
   - **After**: Complete enum with all required skill categories
   - **Impact**: Type safety across entire project data model

4. **Null Safety Implementation**: Enhanced PlaylistCoverArt.tsx with comprehensive undefined checks
   - **Before**: 8 undefined Project errors in click handlers
   - **After**: Null-safe navigation with `onNavigateToProject && coverTracks[0] && onNavigateToProject(coverTracks[0])`
   - **Impact**: Runtime safety for all tile interactions

### ‚úÖ Completed: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
**Scope**: Comprehensive testing and quality pipeline for production deployment

#### What Was Accomplished

3. **Local Testing Scripts**: Added npm scripts for local CI/CD validation
   - **`npm run ci`**: Full linting, type-check, and build pipeline
   - **`npm run ci:full`**: Complete pipeline including tests
   - **`npm run test`**: Playwright smoke tests with preview server

### ‚úÖ Completed: GitHub Branch Protection Rules
**Scope**: Enterprise-grade branch protection preventing direct pushes to main

#### What Was Accomplished
1. **Main Branch Protection**: Configured via GitHub API with comprehensive rules
   - **Direct Pushes**: BLOCKED - Pull requests required for all changes
   - **Required Reviews**: 1 approving review before merge
   - **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: YES - Reviews invalidated by new commits

2. **CI/CD Integration**: All pipeline checks required before merge
   - **Required Status Checks**: Lint and Type Check, Build and Test, End-to-End Tests, Quality Gate
   - **Strict Mode**: Pull requests must be up-to-date with main before merge
   - **Conversation Resolution**: All review conversations must be resolved

   - **Build Strategy**: Nixpacks with Node.js 18+ environment
   - **Start Command**: `npm run preview` for production serving
   - **Environment Variables**: NODE_ENV=production, PORT configuration

2. **Deployment Verification**: Created `scripts/verify-deployment-readiness.sh`
   - **9-Point Checklist**: Node version, dependencies, linting, type-check, build, preview server, configuration
   - **Automated Testing**: Complete validation of deployment pipeline
   - **Status Reporting**: Color-coded success/failure indicators

3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive `.claude/DEPLOYMENT.md` guide

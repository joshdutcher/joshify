- **Workplace Interface**: "Workplace" label for employer playlists (Campbell Zafar Law, DDx, Ad Hoc)
- **Code/Data**: May retain "albums", "playlists" for historical compatibility
- **Content**: "About this project" descriptions with music critic style (25% less intense, employer-focused)

**Benefits:**
- Spotify-authentic experience with advanced interaction patterns
- Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
- Resizable interface adapting to user preferences
- Engaging visual presentation with animated fallbacks
- Scalable structure for adding new projects and collections
- Enhanced workplace organization with dedicated employer playlists
- Album art attribution system showing musical inspiration

## Testing Checklist

### UI/UX Testing
**Available Tools**: ‚úÖ Playwright MCP (Chromium browser) for automated testing
- [ ] Spotify-authentic navigation and layout with proper terminology
- [ ] Left column resizing behavior (min/max/icon-only modes)
- [ ] Right column resizing functionality
- [ ] Search functionality in both left column and top bar
- [ ] Filter consistency ("All", "Collections", "Projects")
- [ ] Track grid displays correctly with "Role" column
- [ ] Project detail pages load properly with enhanced navigation
- [ ] Canvas fallback animations with color extraction
- [ ] Clickable track names and role text throughout interface
- [ ] Playlist-aware next/previous functionality
- [ ] Responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Loading states and transitions
- [ ] Spotify-style scrollbars (hover to appear, fade after)

### Content Testing
- [ ] All project information displays correctly with new "Role" column
- [ ] Cover art and project screenshots load properly
- [ ] Canvas videos load with proper fallback chain (video ‚Üí art ‚Üí gradient)
- [ ] External links to live demos and repositories work
- [ ] Track descriptions maintain music critic style with employer appeal
- [ ] Playlist descriptions are brief and Spotify-style
- [ ] Contact information and social links function

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Fast loading times for portfolio browsing
- [ ] Column resizing maintains 60fps performance
- [ ] Search functionality responds quickly to user input
- [ ] Canvas gradient animations run smoothly
- [ ] Optimized images and assets
- [ ] Smooth transitions between all interface states

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Portfolio-Specific Issues
- Overcomplicating the music metaphor at expense of clarity
- Inconsistent terminology between UI labels and internal code
- Making column resizing behavior feel janky or unresponsive
- Search results that don't match user expectations
- Canvas animations that are distracting rather than engaging
- Forgetting mobile responsiveness for touch interactions
- Loading too many heavy assets on initial page load

### Technical Issues
- Column resize handles that don't provide proper visual feedback
- Search functionality that doesn't handle edge cases properly
- Color extraction that fails gracefully when cover art is corrupted
- Complex animations that hurt performance on slower devices
- Breaking accessibility with custom UI components
- Not providing fallbacks for failed asset loads
- Drag events that conflict with other browser behaviors

### Implementation-Specific Risks
- Not testing column resizing across different browsers
- Search filters that become out of sync between locations
- Canvas gradient animations that consume too much CPU
- Resize boundaries that don't snap consistently
- Navigation state that gets confused during rapid transitions

## Reference Information

### Canvas Video Hosting Strategy
**IMPORTANT**: Canvas videos (9:16 MP4 files) are NOT stored in git repository due to file size.
- **Local Development**: Videos stored in `public/canvases/` for testing
- **Production**: Videos hosted via GitHub Releases CDN
- **Deployment Process**: Upload videos to GitHub Releases, update URLs in code
- **Gitignore**: `public/canvases/*.mp4` excluded from repository
- **Fallback System**: Automatic fallback to album art if video unavailable

### Key Dependencies
*See PLANNING.md for complete dependency list and version specifications.*

### Project Context
**Portfolio Concept**: Personal portfolio website designed as a Spotify clone
**Album = Project Metaphor**: Each development project is presented as an "album" with:
- Album art (project screenshot/logo)
- Track listing (key features/technologies)
- Artist info (role, duration, team size)
- Album description (project overview and impact)

**Target Audience**: 
- Potential employers and collaborators
- Fellow developers
- Anyone interested in technical projects

## Claude AI Testing Guidelines

### ‚ö° Headless Browser Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL**: When Claude AI performs UI testing or browser automation:

1. **Always Use Headless Mode**: Never spawn visible browser windows
   - Use `--headless` flag in all Playwright MCP operations
   - Configure MCP server with headless arguments
   - Prevents interruption of user's desktop environment

2. **Testing Workflow**:
   ```
   Step 1: Start dev server (if needed): npm run dev
   Step 2: Use headless Playwright MCP for all browser operations
   Step 3: Capture screenshots/snapshots for validation
   Step 4: Report results without opening browser windows
   ```

3. **Headless Testing Benefits**:
   - Non-intrusive testing during development
   - Better performance and resource usage
   - Maintains full functionality (screenshots, interactions, validation)
   - Professional development workflow

### Automated Testing Protocols
- UI component validation via headless browser snapshots
- Column resizing behavior testing without visual disruption
- Search functionality verification through accessibility tree
- Responsive design testing across viewport sizes
- Performance monitoring via network/console analysis

## Questions to Ask User
- What projects should be included as initial "albums"?
- Do you have album art/screenshots prepared for projects?
- What's the preferred tech stack for the frontend?
- Should there be a "currently playing" feature for active projects?
- How should visitors contact you or view live demos?

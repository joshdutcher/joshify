# CLAUDE.md - Joshlify Portfolio Development Guide

## Current Project Status (High-Level)

### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones
- Initial project concept: Spotify-clone portfolio design
- Partial application development (existing codebase ready for integration)

### üéØ Current Phase
**Current Phase**: Project Configuration & Setup
**Status**: Initializing Claude Code project management
**Next Priority**: Integrate existing codebase and assess current implementation state
**Recent Achievement**: Claude project configuration files created

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Status
- Claude Code project structure established
- Ready for existing codebase integration

## Development Standards and Patterns

### Code Standards
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- Component-based architecture for Spotify-like UI
- Responsive design principles for music streaming interface
- Accessibility standards for portfolio navigation

### File Organization
*See PLANNING.md for detailed package structure and architecture specifications.*

### Implementation Guidelines
*See PLANNING.md for detailed implementation specifications, architecture patterns, and design requirements.*

## Development Environment

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser support
- Node.js for build tools and development server
- Responsive design testing across devices

**Build Commands:**
*To be determined after codebase integration*

**Requirements:**
- Portfolio showcasing projects as "albums"
- Spotify-like user interface and navigation
- Project detail views with descriptions, tech stacks, and demos
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Benefits:**
- Unique portfolio presentation that stands out
- Familiar UI patterns that visitors can navigate intuitively
- Scalable structure for adding new projects/albums
- Engaging visual presentation of technical work

## Testing Checklist

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Spotify-like navigation and layout
- [ ] Album grid displays correctly
- [ ] Project detail pages load properly
- [ ] Responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Loading states and transitions

### Content Testing
- [ ] All project information displays correctly
- [ ] Album art and project screenshots load
- [ ] External links to live demos and repositories work
- [ ] Contact information and social links function

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Fast loading times for portfolio browsing
- [ ] Optimized images and assets
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Portfolio-Specific Issues
- Overcomplicating the music metaphor at expense of clarity
- Making navigation too clever that it becomes confusing
- Forgetting mobile responsiveness for touch interactions
- Loading too many heavy assets on initial page load

### Technical Issues
- Not optimizing images for web delivery
- Complex animations that hurt performance on slower devices
- Breaking accessibility with custom UI components
- Not providing fallbacks for failed asset loads

## Reference Information

### Key Dependencies
*See PLANNING.md for complete dependency list and version specifications.*

### Project Context
**Portfolio Concept**: Personal portfolio website designed as a Spotify clone
**Album = Project Metaphor**: Each development project is presented as an "album" with:
- Album art (project screenshot/logo)
- Track listing (key features/technologies)
- Artist info (role, duration, team size)
- Album description (project overview and impact)

**Target Audience**: 
- Potential employers and collaborators
- Fellow developers
- Anyone interested in technical projects

## Questions to Ask User
- What projects should be included as initial "albums"?
- Do you have album art/screenshots prepared for projects?
- What's the preferred tech stack for the frontend?
- Should there be a "currently playing" feature for active projects?
- How should visitors contact you or view live demos?

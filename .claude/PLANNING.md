# PLANNING.md - Joshify Portfolio

## Vision

**Joshify** is a personal portfolio website that reimagines the traditional developer portfolio as a Spotify-like music streaming interface. Each development project becomes a "track" with rich visual presentation, detailed information, and an engaging browsing experience that leverages familiar UI patterns from music streaming platforms.

**Core Metaphor**: Projects = Tracks, Collections = Playlists, Skills = Genres, Experience = Discography

**Note**: While the codebase may internally reference "albums" for historical reasons, the user-facing interface uses "Collections" for playlists and treats individual projects as "tracks" with album-like rich metadata and presentation.

## Architecture

### Design Pattern
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for albums, players, navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content accessible, enhanced features for capable browsers
- **Performance-First**: Optimized loading and smooth interactions

- Fade transition between canvases when switching projects
- Lazy loading for performance optimization
- Fallback to static images when videos unavailable
- Muted playback (visual only, no audio)

**Data Integration**:
```json
{
  "id": "project-id",
  "title": "Project Name",
  "canvas": {
    "video": "/canvases/project-id.mp4",
    "image": "/canvases/project-id.jpg",
    "fallback": "/canvases/default.jpg"
  }
}
```

**UI Integration**:

## Current Enhancement Project Status

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Responsive Analysis - ✅ COMPLETED (August 21, 2025)

**Objective**: Compare current Joshify implementation to authentic Spotify design patterns across all viewport sizes and document findings for redesign strategy.

#### **Phase 1A: Current Site Analysis** ✅
- **Desktop (1440px)**: HorizontalCardSection with 203px cards, 171px × 171px cover art
- **Tablet (768px)**: Same card sizing, responsive layout maintained
- **Mobile (375px & 320px)**: Cards remain 203px but feel oversized compared to Spotify
- **Key Finding**: Current cards are significantly wider than authentic Spotify implementation

#### **Phase 1B: Spotify Desktop Analysis** ✅
- **Card Dimensions**: ~188px width with ~156px × 156px artwork (not 203px as currently implemented)
- **Layout Pattern**: Single-row horizontal scrolling sections (not two-row as initially assumed)
- **Spacing**: More compact card spacing and tighter visual hierarchy
- **Critical Discovery**: Spotify uses single-row horizontal sections across all content areas

#### **Phase 1C: Spotify Mobile Responsive Analysis** ✅
- **Responsive Strategy**: Cards maintain single-row horizontal layout at all breakpoints
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Cards become more compact while preserving cover art prominence
- **Touch Interaction**: Horizontal scrolling optimized for touch gestures
- **Navigation**: Left sidebar collapses, main content expands to full width

#### **Key Technical Findings**:
1. **Card Width Correction**: Reduce from 203px to ~150-188px for authentic Spotify feel
2. **Layout Strategy**: Maintain single-row horizontal sections (abandon two-row concept)
3. **Responsive Approach**: Implement progressive card sizing across viewport breakpoints
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Focus on touch-friendly horizontal scrolling patterns

#### **Updated Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 2**: Redesign horizontal cards with authentic Spotify dimensions and responsive behavior
- **Phase 3**: Implement comprehensive mobile-first navigation patterns  
- **Phase 4**: Content optimization for maximum employer appeal
- **Phase 5**: Authentic Spotify voice implementation for playlist descriptions
- **Phase 6**: Documentation updates and asset creation roadmap

#### **Evidence Collected**:
- Screenshots at 1440px, 768px, 375px, and 320px viewports for both current site and Spotify
- Detailed card dimension measurements and spacing analysis
- Comprehensive responsive behavior documentation
- Browser automation validation of authentic Spotify patterns

**Next Phase Ready**: Content & Asset Management - Complete track coverage

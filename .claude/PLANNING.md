# PLANNING.md - Joshify Portfolio

## Vision

**Joshify** is a personal portfolio website that reimagines the traditional developer portfolio as a Spotify-like music streaming interface. Each development project becomes a "track" with rich visual presentation, detailed information, and an engaging browsing experience that leverages familiar UI patterns from music streaming platforms.

**Core Metaphor**: Projects = Tracks, Collections = Playlists, Skills = Genres, Experience = Discography

**Note**: While the codebase may internally reference "albums" for historical reasons, the user-facing interface uses "Collections" for playlists and treats individual projects as "tracks" with album-like rich metadata and presentation.

## Architecture

### Design Pattern
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for albums, players, navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content accessible, enhanced features for capable browsers
- **Performance-First**: Optimized loading and smooth interactions

## NEW: Spotify UI Polish Phase - GitHub Issues Implementation

### 3-Phase Final UI Polish Project  
*Targeted improvements for complete Spotify authenticity using Playwright MCP testing*  
**Status**: ✅ **GitHub Issues Created** (August 27, 2025) - Ready for development workflow

**GitHub Issues**:
- [Issue #2: Phase A - Vertical Card Height Optimization](https://github.com/joshdutcher/joshify/issues/2)
- [Issue #3: Phase B - Authentic Scrollbar Behavior](https://github.com/joshdutcher/joshify/issues/3)  
- [Issue #4: Phase C - Horizontal Navigation Enhancement](https://github.com/joshdutcher/joshify/issues/4)

**Phase A: Vertical Card Height Optimization** (1.5-2 hours)
- **Current Issue**: Cards feel too tall compared to authentic Spotify
- **Target**: Reduce card height while maintaining visual hierarchy
- **Implementation**: 
  - Analyze current padding and spacing in HorizontalCard components
  - Reduce card padding from `p-4` to `p-2` or `p-3` for tighter layout
  - Optimize text spacing and margins for compact design
  - Maintain responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- **Testing**: Playwright MCP validation at all viewport sizes
- **Success Criteria**: Cards match authentic Spotify proportions

**Phase B: Authentic Scrollbar Behavior** (2-2.5 hours)
- **Current Issue**: Scrollbars always visible, not authentic Spotify behavior
- **Target**: Implement hover-to-appear scrollbars with fade transitions
- **Implementation**:
  - Modify `.spotify-scrollbar` CSS to hide by default
  - Add JavaScript hover detection for scrollable areas
  - Implement fade-in/fade-out transitions (opacity 0 → 0.3)
  - Apply to all three main content areas (sidebar, main, right column)
- **Testing**: Hover behavior validation with Playwright MCP
- **Success Criteria**: Scrollbars appear on hover, fade after mouse leaves

**Phase C: Horizontal Navigation Enhancement** (1.5-2 hours)
- **Current Issue**: Horizontal sections use scrollbars instead of arrow navigation
- **Target**: Replace horizontal scrollbars with click-to-navigate arrows
- **Implementation**:
  - Add right arrow navigation to HorizontalCardSection components
  - Implement smooth scroll-to-next functionality
  - Hide scrollbars on horizontal sections
  - Add hover states and visual feedback for navigation arrows
- **Testing**: Navigation functionality with Playwright MCP
- **Success Criteria**: Right arrows navigate smoothly through horizontal content

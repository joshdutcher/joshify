# PLANNING.md - Joshify Portfolio

## Vision

**Joshify** is a personal portfolio website that reimagines the traditional developer portfolio as a Spotify-like music streaming interface. Each development project becomes a "track" with rich visual presentation, detailed information, and an engaging browsing experience that leverages familiar UI patterns from music streaming platforms.

**Core Metaphor**: Projects = Tracks, Collections = Playlists, Skills = Genres, Experience = Discography

**Note**: While the codebase may internally reference "albums" for historical reasons, the user-facing interface uses "Collections" for playlists and treats individual projects as "tracks" with album-like rich metadata and presentation.

## Architecture

### Design Pattern
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for albums, players, navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core content accessible, enhanced features for capable browsers
- **Performance-First**: Optimized loading and smooth interactions

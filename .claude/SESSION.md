## Mobile API Rebuild Cover Art & Canvas Video Integration (Completed - ~15 minutes)

#### Multimedia Asset Integration (Completed - ~15 minutes)
1. ✅ **Cover Art Integration**: Successfully integrated Mobile API Rebuild album artwork:
   - **Source File**: `designref/track-art/mobile-api-rebuild.png` (1.4MB)
   - **Destination**: `public/album-art/mobile-api.png` (renamed to match project ID pattern)
   - **Project Data Update**: Set `image: '/album-art/mobile-api.png'` and enabled `isAlbum: true`
   - **Display Locations**: Now appears in home page cards, playlist views, bottom player, search results

2. ✅ **Canvas Video Integration**: Implemented canvas video with corrected file:
   - **Initial File**: `designref/track-art/mobile-api-rebuild.mp4` (2.3MB) → `public/canvases/mobile-api.mp4`
   - **Corrected File**: Replaced with updated video (2.6MB) after user provided corrected version
   - **Dynamic Detection**: System automatically detects video using project ID pattern (`mobile-api.mp4`)
   - **Canvas Display**: Video now plays in right column when Mobile API Rebuild is selected

#### Technical Implementation Details
3. ✅ **File Naming Strategy**: Adopted consistent project ID-based naming convention:
   - **Project ID**: `mobile-api` matches filename pattern for dynamic detection
   - **Canvas Utils**: Existing `canvasUtils.js` automatically finds `/canvases/mobile-api.mp4`
   - **Fallback Chain**: Video → Cover Art → Animated Gradient (no explicit canvas object needed)

4. ✅ **Canvas Video Troubleshooting**: Resolved initial video loading issue:
   - **Root Cause**: Filename mismatch (used full name instead of project ID pattern)
   - **Solution**: Renamed files to match existing dynamic detection system
   - **Cache Handling**: System will re-detect files on next page refresh

   - **Result**: All canvas videos now play correctly with proper fallback chain

4. ✅ **Album Art Canvas Display Fix**: Fixed Election Data Pipeline not showing album art in canvas:
   - **Root Cause**: ProjectCanvas component had early return for `canvas: null` that only showed animated gradient
   - **Solution**: Modified to check for project album art first, then fall back to gradient
   - **Data Cleanup**: Set Election Data Pipeline `canvas: null` instead of broken video path
   - **Result**: Projects without canvas videos now display their album art in the canvas area

5. ✅ **Content-Driven Canvas Layout**: Implemented flexible canvas container for album art:
   - **Problem**: Square album art was cropped in vertical 9:16 canvas container
   - **Solution**: Made canvas container content-driven instead of aspect-ratio-driven for album art
   - **Key Changes**: 
     - Removed `aspect-canvas` for album art fallbacks
     - Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
     - Used flexible container that adjusts to image dimensions
   - **Result**: Album art displays completely without cropping and scales proportionally when column resizes

6. ✅ **Color Extraction System Fix**: Enhanced background gradient color extraction:
   - **Updated Logic**: Properly extracts colors from canvas images OR project album art
   - **Priority System**: Canvas image → project image → no gradient (flat charcoal)
   - **Fallback Behavior**: No more default Spotify green when images fail to load
   - **Result**: Background gradients now properly reflect album art colors

### Technical Implementation Highlights

#### Layout Engineering Solutions
- **Responsive Scaling**: Canvas area now grows/shrinks both horizontally and vertically with column resizing
- **Aspect Ratio Management**: Videos maintain 9:16, album art uses natural dimensions
- **Content Preservation**: No more cropping of square images in vertical containers
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Different fallback behaviors for different UI contexts

   - **Solution**: Allow direct mouse-following when transitioning from icon mode, apply constraints only on mouse release
   - **Implementation**: Modified `useColumnResize.js` to use different constraint logic based on current mode
   - **Result**: Column now follows mouse exactly (95px, 102px, etc.) when exiting icon mode

2. ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Eliminated resize lag through React optimization:
   - **Issue**: Component key prop causing complete unmount/remount on mode changes (`key={sidebar-${leftColumnMode}}`)
   - **Issue**: Forced re-renders in Sidebar component (`useReducer` force updates)
   - **Issue**: Synchronous React state updates during drag causing performance hitches
   - **Solutions**: 
     - Removed key prop to allow normal React updates instead of component recreation
     - Removed forced re-render logic from Sidebar component
     - Used `requestAnimationFrame` to defer state updates during drag operations
   - **Result**: Smooth, lag-free resizing matching Spotify's authentic performance

3. ✅ **Mouse Position Calculation Fix**: Resolved width calculation during mode transitions:
   - **Issue**: Dynamic `getBoundingClientRect()` calculations using current sidebar position instead of initial position
   - **Solution**: Capture initial sidebar left position at drag start, use as fixed reference point
   - **Implementation**: `const sidebarInitialLeft = sidebarElement?.getBoundingClientRect().left || 0;`
   - **Result**: Consistent, accurate width calculations throughout entire drag session

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing & Validation**: Ensured all resize behaviors work correctly:
   - **Icon Mode Entry**: ✅ Smooth snap to 72px when dragging left past 96px threshold
   - **Icon Mode Exit**: ✅ Immediate mouse-following when dragging right from icon mode  
   - **Normal Resizing**: ✅ Proper min/max constraints (280px-420px) during normal operation
   - **Performance**: ✅ Spotify-authentic performance with acceptable lag matching reference
   - **Cross-Browser**: ✅ Consistent behavior across modern browsers

#### Technical Achievements (Phase 3 Final Completion)
5. ✅ **Spotify-Authentic Behavior**: Perfect replication of Spotify's column resizing patterns
   - Exact threshold behavior (96px trigger for icon mode)
   - Proper mouse-following when transitioning between modes

## Phase 6.8: Spotify-Style Scrollbar Implementation (In Progress - ~45 minutes)

#### Scrollbar Technical Investigation & Implementation (Ongoing)
1. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified CSS specificity conflicts preventing hover scrollbars:
   - **Issue**: Global `* { scrollbar-width: none; }` rule was overriding `.spotify-scrollbar:hover` styles
   - **Impact**: Scrollbars remained hidden even on hover, preventing Spotify-authentic behavior
   - **Reference**: Original attempt documented in Phase 6.7 was blocked by this CSS conflict

2. ✅ **CSS Architecture Redesign**: Resolved global override conflicts with targeted approach:
   - **Removed Global Override**: Changed from hiding ALL scrollbars to targeting specific elements (body, html, #root)
   - **Modern Scrollbar Approach**: Used `scrollbar-width: thin` with transparent colors becoming visible on hover
   - **Webkit Configuration**: Set up proper webkit scrollbar properties for Chrome/Safari with smooth transitions
   - **Browser Support**: Firefox fallback using `scrollbar-width` and `scrollbar-color` properties

3. ✅ **Right Column Scrolling Implementation**: Enabled comprehensive scrolling for NowPlayingPanel:
   - **Scope Expansion**: Applied scrolling to entire right column including canvas video section (not just content area)
   - **Layout Architecture**: Modified container from `lg:flex lg:flex-col` to `lg:block` with `overflow-y-auto spotify-scrollbar`
   - **Unified Scroll Area**: Canvas video + project details now scroll together as one continuous column
   - **Consistency**: All three main areas (left sidebar, main content, right panel) now have identical scrollbar behavior

#### Current Scrollbar Implementation Status
4. ✅ **Functionality**: All scrollable areas working correctly with smooth scrolling
5. ✅ **Applied Areas**: Left sidebar content, main content area, and complete right column (including canvas)
6. ⚠️ **Visual Appearance**: Scrollbars appear but don't match authentic Spotify design reference
   - **Current State**: Scrollbars are visible and functional with hover behavior
   - **Issue**: Visual styling doesn't match the translucent block appearance shown in `designref/scrollbars.png`
   - **Next**: Need to refine CSS styling to achieve pixel-perfect Spotify appearance

#### Technical Implementation Details
- **CSS Approach**: Webkit scrollbar styling with transparent→visible transitions
- **Performance**: Smooth 0.2s transitions for appearance/disappearance  
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome/Safari webkit properties + Firefox fallback
- **Layout Impact**: Overlay scrollbars don't affect content positioning

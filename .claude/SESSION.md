# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - October 24, 2025
**Status**: Complete
**Focus**: CI/CD Configuration Cleanup

### Session Context
Investigated PR #25 merge blocker, identified circular dependency in CI/CD workflow, and streamlined deployment process.

### Session Accomplishments
1. **Diagnosed PR #25 Issue**:
   - Identified "End-to-End Tests" requirement in branch protection ruleset
   - Removed non-existent E2E test requirement from GitHub ruleset
   - PR unblocked successfully

2. **Fixed Circular Deployment Logic**:
   - Removed `deploy-to-railway` job from GitHub Actions workflow
   - Removed `deployment-notification` job from GitHub Actions workflow
   - Clarified that Railway handles auto-deploy directly from `main` branch

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Revised CI/CD Pipeline section in CLAUDE.md
   - Documented Railway auto-deploy strategy
   - Explained why deployment jobs were removed (circular dependency)
   - Added branch protection ruleset details

### Technical Changes
- Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Removed deployment jobs
- Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - CI/CD and deployment documentation

### Key Decisions
- **Deployment Strategy**: Railway auto-deploy from `main` branch (not GitHub Actions)
- **Playwright Usage**: Development-only tool, NOT part of CI/CD pipeline
- **Required Checks**: Lint, Type Check, Build, Quality Gate (deployment excluded)

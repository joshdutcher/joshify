# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - October 3, 2025
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - DNS Propagation
**Focus**: Cloudflare CDN Setup for Canvas Video Performance

### Session Context
- Joshify portfolio project: Spotify-clone personal portfolio
- Goal: Fix slow canvas video loading by implementing Cloudflare CDN
- **Achievement**: Complete Cloudflare DNS transfer and CDN configuration

### Session Summary

#### Problem Identified
Canvas videos loading from Backblaze B2 direct URLs were **extremely slow** (>1 second delay after page load), degrading user experience.

#### Solution Implemented
**Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare CDN Proxy** setup for global edge caching:

1. ✅ **Transferred DNS to Cloudflare**
   - Domain `joshify.dev` DNS now managed by Cloudflare
   - Domain registration remains at Namecheap
   - Nameservers updated (propagation in progress)

2. ✅ **Created CDN Subdomain**
   - `cdn.joshify.dev` CNAME → `f000.backblazeb2.com`
   - **Proxy Status**: Enabled (orange cloud) - **CRITICAL FOR CDN**
   - Production URL: `https://cdn.joshify.dev/file/joshify-canvas/`

3. ✅ **Updated B2 Bucket CORS**
   - Added `https://cdn.joshify.dev` to allowed origins
   - Configured for production and local development domains

4. ✅ **Updated Environment Variables**
   - `.env.production`: `VITE_CANVAS_CDN_URL=https://cdn.joshify.dev/file/joshify-canvas`
   - Railway: Pending update (waiting for DNS propagation)

5. ✅ **Installed Wrangler CLI**
   - Cloudflare CLI tool installed globally via npm
   - Version 4.42.0
   - Available for future Cloudflare operations

6. ✅ **Removed B2 CLI**
   - Uninstalled B2 CLI (no longer needed with Wrangler available)
   - Cleaned up temporary venv installations

### Expected Performance Improvement

**Before** (Direct B2):
- First load: ~1-2 seconds
- No caching
- Direct connection to B2 origin servers

**After** (Cloudflare CDN - once DNS propagates):
- First load: ~1-2 seconds (populates cache)
- Subsequent loads: **< 100ms** (from edge cache)
- Global edge caching in 200+ cities

### Implementation Details

#### Files Modified
1. **CREATED**: `.claude/CDN_CONFIGURATION.md` - Complete CDN documentation
2. **UPDATED**: `.env.production` - CDN URL changed from direct B2 to Cloudflare proxy

#### Tools Installed
- **Wrangler**: 4.42.0 (Cloudflare CLI) - `npm install -g wrangler`
- **Removed**: B2 CLI (replaced by Wrangler)

#### DNS Configuration
- **Domain**: `joshify.dev`
- **Registrar**: Namecheap (domain registration)
- **DNS Provider**: Cloudflare (nameservers transferred)
- **CDN Subdomain**: `cdn.joshify.dev` → Proxied CNAME to B2

### Pending Actions

#### Immediate (User)
1. **Wait for DNS Propagation**: 5 minutes to 48 hours
   - Nameservers transferred to Cloudflare
   - CDN subdomain will become active once propagated

2. **Update Railway Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   VITE_CANVAS_CDN_URL=https://cdn.joshify.dev/file/joshify-canvas
   ```
   - Wait until DNS propagates before updating
   - Test CDN endpoint first: `curl -I https://cdn.joshify.dev/file/joshify-canvas/beer-fridge.mp4`

#### Verification Steps (After DNS Propagation)

**Test DNS Resolution**:
```bash
dig +short cdn.joshify.dev
# Should return: f000.backblazeb2.com
```

**Test CDN Endpoint**:
```bash
curl -I https://cdn.joshify.dev/file/joshify-canvas/beer-fridge.mp4
# Look for: cf-cache-status header (HIT or MISS)
```

**Test in Production**:
1. Update Railway environment variable
2. Deploy to production
3. Navigate to project with canvas video
4. Verify fast loading times

### Technical Achievements
- **Zero-Cost CDN**: Leveraging Cloudflare free tier for unlimited bandwidth
- **Global Performance**: Videos cached in 200+ edge locations
- **Production Ready**: No rate limits, professional custom domain
- **Simple Maintenance**: Single CNAME record manages entire CDN setup

### Architecture Decisions

**Why B2 + Cloudflare CDN (not R2)?**
1. **Already Set Up**: B2 bucket with all videos uploaded
2. **Cost Effective**: $0.00/month within free tiers
3. **Simple Integration**: Single CNAME with proxy enabled
4. **R2 Limitation**: Custom domains require Cloudflare-managed DNS (now resolved!)
5. **Future Flexibility**: Can migrate to R2 later if needed

**Why Transfer DNS to Cloudflare?**
- **Required for CDN**: Cloudflare proxy only works with Cloudflare-managed DNS
- **No Cost**: Domain registration stays at Namecheap
- **Bonus Features**: Free SSL, DDoS protection, analytics
- **Full Control**: Complete DNS management in Cloudflare dashboard

### Documentation Created
- ✅ **CDN_CONFIGURATION.md**: Complete reference guide
  - Architecture overview
  - DNS and CORS configuration
  - Environment variables
  - Testing and troubleshooting
  - Cost analysis
  - Maintenance procedures

### Known Items for Future Work
- **DNS Propagation**: Monitor and verify (up to 48 hours)
- **Railway Update**: Add CDN URL to environment variables after DNS propagates
- **Performance Testing**: Measure actual load times once CDN active
- **CI/CD Optimization** (from TASKS.md):
  - Remove unit tests requiring Playwright
  - Remove Playwright installation from CI/CD workflow

### Session Notes
- DNS transfer initiated - propagation in progress
- Wrangler CLI authenticated and ready for Cloudflare operations
- B2 bucket CORS updated for CDN subdomain
- Production deployment pending DNS propagation
- All canvas videos remain in B2 bucket (78MB total)

### Verification Status
- ✅ Cloudflare DNS transfer initiated
- ✅ CDN CNAME record created with proxy enabled
- ✅ B2 CORS configuration updated
- ✅ Environment variables updated locally
- ⏳ DNS propagation in progress
- ⏳ Railway environment variable update pending
- ⏳ Production CDN testing pending DNS propagation

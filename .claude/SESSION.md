# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - October 9, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Focus**: Mobile UI Fix - Hide "Good afternoon" Section on Mobile Devices

### Session Context
- Joshify portfolio: Spotify-clone personal portfolio with production CI/CD
- Issue: Mobile display showing broken "Good afternoon" cards (too many, tall/narrow, cropped art, missing text)
- Goal: Match Spotify's authentic mobile behavior by hiding section on mobile devices

### Session Accomplishments

#### Mobile UI Fix - "Good afternoon" Section
**Problem**: On mobile devices, the "Good afternoon" section displayed incorrectly:
- Too many cards in a row (8 cards)
- Cards rendered tall and narrow
- Album art cropped on right side
- Text missing below images

**Solution Delivered**:
1. ✅ Compared Joshify vs Spotify mobile layouts using Playwright MCP
2. ✅ Identified Spotify hides "Good afternoon" section entirely on mobile
3. ✅ Wrapped section in responsive container: `<div className="hidden md:block">`
4. ✅ Verified mobile display (< 768px): Section completely hidden
5. ✅ Verified tablet display (768px+): Section visible and functional
6. ✅ Verified desktop display (1920px): No changes, all functionality preserved

**Technical Implementation**:
- **File Modified**: `src/components/views/HomeView.tsx`
- **Change**: Added responsive wrapper around greeting heading and AdaptiveCardGrid
- **Breakpoint**: Uses Tailwind `md` breakpoint (768px)
- **Behavior**: Hidden below 768px, visible at 768px and above

**Benefits**:
- **Authentic Mobile UX**: Matches Spotify's mobile behavior exactly
- **Clean Mobile Layout**: Shows only vertical card sections ("Made for you", "Top hits", "Side projects")
- **Preserved Desktop**: No changes to tablet/desktop experience
- **Simple Solution**: Single responsive wrapper, no complex logic

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Mobile (412px): "Good afternoon" hidden, clean vertical layout
- ✅ Tablet (768px): "Good afternoon" visible with horizontal cards
- ✅ Desktop (1920px): Full section visible, unchanged functionality

### Previous Session Accomplishments

#### CI/CD Pipeline Simplification (October 9, 2025)
**Problem**: Playwright E2E tests in CI/CD added complexity and build time without significant value

**Solution Delivered**:
1. ✅ Removed `e2e-tests` job from GitHub Actions workflow
2. ✅ Updated job dependencies (pr-validation, quality-gate no longer depend on e2e-tests)
3. ✅ Removed Playwright dependencies from package.json (`@playwright/test`, `playwright`)
4. ✅ Removed test scripts (`test`, `test:smoke`, `test:install`, `ci:full`)
5. ✅ Deleted playwright.smoke.config.js
6. ✅ Deleted playwright-report directory
7. ✅ Updated documentation (CLAUDE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, SESSION.md)

**Benefits**:
- **Faster CI/CD**: 3-stage pipeline instead of 4 (removes E2E test job)
- **Simpler maintenance**: No Playwright browser installation in CI
- **Clearer focus**: CI/CD focuses on TypeScript + ESLint validation
- **Still available**: Playwright MCP remains for manual testing

**CI/CD Pipeline Now**:
1. Lint and Type Check
2. Build and Test
3. Quality Gate

**Note**: Playwright MCP still available in WSL2 for manual testing, just not part of automated CI/CD pipeline.

#### Vite 5 Upgrade (October 9, 2025)
**Problem**: Limited to Vite 4.4.5, blocking modern plugin ecosystem

**Solution Delivered**:
1. ✅ Upgraded Vite: 4.4.5 → 5.4.20
2. ✅ Upgraded @vitejs/plugin-react: 4.0.3 → 4.7.0
3. ✅ Verified compatibility with GitHub Actions CI/CD (Node.js 18+)
4. ✅ Verified compatibility with Railway production (Nixpacks auto-detection)
5. ✅ Zero breaking changes, builds successfully

**Benefits**:
- **50% faster** dev server startup
- **Better plugin ecosystem** access
- **Improved HMR** and error messages
- **Active long-term support**

#### Automated Image Optimization Implementation (October 9, 2025)
**Problem**: Manual script required for each new album art image

**Solution Delivered**:
1. ✅ Installed `vite-plugin-image-optimizer` v2.0.2 (official plugin)
2. ✅ Configured automatic PNG → WebP conversion at quality 90
3. ✅ Implemented build-time optimization (zero manual work)
4. ✅ Added intelligent caching (`.cache/vite-image-optimizer`)
5. ✅ Removed manual `scripts/optimize-images.sh` (no longer needed)

**Results**:
- **15 PNG files** optimized: 40-86% reduction per image
- **15 WebP files** auto-generated during build
- **Total savings**: 9.3MB / 12.5MB ≈ **75% file size reduction**
- **Example**: `democracy-engine.png`: 1.6MB → 238KB (86% smaller!)

**Workflow Now**:
```bash
# Add new album art
cp new-project.png public/album-art/

# Build (local or CI/CD)
npm run build

# Done! Auto-optimized PNG + WebP generated
```

### Technical Details

**Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
- Added `ViteImageOptimizer` plugin
- PNG optimization: quality 90
- WebP generation: quality 90
- Cache location: `.cache/vite-image-optimizer`
- Optimization runs on every build

**Optimization Environments**:
- ✅ **Local builds**: `npm run build` auto-optimizes
- ✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automatic during pipeline builds
- ✅ **Railway Production**: Optimizes during deployment builds
- ✅ **Dev mode**: Uses original files from `public/` (fast iteration)

**Files Modified**:
- `vite.config.ts` - Added ViteImageOptimizer plugin
- `package.json` - Vite 5 dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency updates
- `.gitignore` - Added `.cache/` directory

**Existing Components** (Unchanged):
- `src/components/ProjectImage.tsx` - Already uses `<picture>` with WebP/PNG fallback
- `src/components/AlbumArtModal.tsx` - Already supports both formats

### Future Workflow
**Adding new album art** is now a single step:
1. Drop PNG file in `public/album-art/`
2. Build process auto-generates optimized PNG + WebP
3. No manual optimization scripts needed

**Maintenance**: Zero - fully automated in build pipeline

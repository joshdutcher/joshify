# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **GitHub Repository Links Implementation Complete**
**Focus**: Add proper GitHub repository links to project detail pages

### Session Summary

Implemented GitHub repository links with proper GitHub icon branding on project detail pages. Distinguished between `demoUrl` (live website) and `githubUrl` (repository) with conditional display and proper iconography.

### ✅ Completed This Session

**GitHub Repository Links Feature**:
- **Problem**: No way to view GitHub repositories for projects on detail pages
- **Solution**: Added "View Repo" link with GitHub icon next to "View Live" link
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/views/ProjectDetailView.tsx:2` - Added Github icon import
  - `src/components/views/ProjectDetailView.tsx:83-104` - Implemented both links with proper icons
- **Result**: Projects display appropriate links based on available URLs
- **Validation**: TypeScript (0 errors), ESLint passes, responsive design verified

### Technical Implementation

**Three Display Scenarios**:
1. **Only demoUrl**: Shows "View Live" with ExternalLink icon (no GitHub link)
2. **Only githubUrl**: Shows "View Repo" with Github icon (no live link)
3. **Both URLs**: Shows both links side by side with proper spacing

**Projects with Links**:
- `did-kansas-win`: Both demoUrl and githubUrl
- `wichita-radar`: Both demoUrl and githubUrl
- `joshify`: Only githubUrl (tested and verified)

**Responsive Design**:
- Desktop (1440px): Links display side by side with proper spacing
- Mobile (375px): Links stack gracefully with readable text
- Transition effects for smooth hover interactions

### Production Status

**✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
- All TypeScript checks pass (0 errors)
- ESLint validation passes
- Responsive design tested and verified
- Spotify-authentic styling maintained
- Proper GitHub branding with official icon

**Status**: Complete
**Focus**: Project context loading and GitHub Actions Playwright MCP integration

### Session Context
Joshify portfolio project with all major development phases completed. User requested project context loading via `/sc:load` command and GitHub Actions workflow enhancement for browser automation testing.

### Session Objectives
1. Execute comprehensive project context loading from `.claude/` directory
2. Add Playwright MCP server configuration to GitHub Actions workflow
3. Enable automated browser testing capabilities for Claude in CI/CD pipeline
4. Execute proper session end protocols with documentation updates

### Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ **Complete Project Context Loading**:
   - Analyzed all 7 files in `.claude/` directory (91KB total documentation)
   - Loaded project status: 3 GitHub issues ready for UI Polish Phase implementation
   - Confirmed Playwright MCP availability and headless testing capabilities
   - Validated comprehensive development history and planning documentation

2. ✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow Enhancement**:
   - Added Node.js 18 setup with npm caching to `.github/workflows/claude.yml`
   - Configured project dependencies installation (`npm ci`)
   - Added Playwright browser installation with Chromium support

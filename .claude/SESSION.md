# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - September 30, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Canvas Display Fix
**Focus**: Fix canvas video and album art display issues

### Session Context
- Joshify portfolio project: Spotify-clone personal portfolio
- Goal: Resolve canvas display regression affecting album art and video display
- **ACHIEVEMENT**: Conditional aspect ratio system implemented for proper canvas display

### Final Status - Canvas Display Issues Resolved

#### ✅ Canvas Display Fix
- **Issue 1**: Projects with canvas videos showing album art fallback instead of videos
  - Root cause: CORS errors from GitHub Releases CDN (expected in local dev)
  - Resolution: Verified fallback chain working correctly (video → album art → gradient)
  - Production: Videos load properly in deployed environment

- **Issue 2**: Album art displaying in 9:16 rectangular format with cropped sides
  - Root cause: Fixed aspect ratio container for all content types
  - Resolution: Implemented conditional aspect ratio based on content type
  - Result: Album art displays in square (1:1) container, videos use 9:16 container

#### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Conditional Aspect Ratio Logic**: `aspect-square` for album art, `aspect-canvas` for videos
- **Dynamic Container Sizing**: Canvas area adapts based on content type and error state
- **Responsive Behavior**: Properly resizes with resizable right column
- **Fallback Chain**: Canvas video → Album art (square) → Animated gradient

### Key Files Modified This Session
- `src/components/ProjectCanvas.tsx`: Implemented conditional aspect ratio system
  - Added `useSquareAspect` logic for dynamic container sizing
  - Ensured proper fallback chain handling
  - Maintained responsive behavior with resizable columns

### Session Notes
- Investigated data structure change: canvas object → simple string URL
- CORS errors are expected in local development, videos work in production
- Verified fix with Playwright MCP browser testing
- Album art now displays full square image without cropping
- Text flows directly below canvas area (top-aligned)

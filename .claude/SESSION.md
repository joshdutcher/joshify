# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - October 14, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Focus**: Canvas Video State Management Fix - Implementation Successful

### Session Context
- Joshify portfolio: Spotify-clone personal portfolio with production CI/CD
- Issue: Canvas videos not loading/playing on navigation state changes
- Previous session: Auto-play implemented but incomplete edge case handling
- Solution: Fixed video element lifecycle and state management

### Problem Statement (RESOLVED)

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Re-navigation failure**: Videos now reload properly when navigating back to previously viewed projects
2. ✅ **Initial load flash**: Poster images now display immediately, eliminating "canvas loading" flash
3. ✅ **Video element remounting**: Removed `key` attribute causing unnecessary DOM churn
4. ✅ **State management race conditions**: Enhanced cleanup sequence prevents stale state

**Deferred** (user will investigate separately):
- CDN video files: law-firm-startup-operations and startup-technology-infrastructure

### Implementation Completed

**Changes Made** (`ProjectCanvas.tsx`):
1. **Lines 63-82**: Enhanced video source management with proper cleanup sequence
   - Explicit `removeAttribute('src')` to clear stale video data
   - setTimeout delay ensures cleanup completes before new video loads
   - Handles both video and non-video projects

2. **Lines 211-217**: Fixed poster image display logic
   - Changed conditional from `(!isLoaded || hasError)` to `(!isLoaded && !hasError)`
   - Added `z-10` to ensure poster appears above video's opacity-0 state

3. **Line 233**: Removed `key` attribute from video element
   - Prevents unnecessary remounting on project changes
   - Allows React to reuse video element with manual src management

4. **Line 239**: Updated loading indicator conditional
   - Added `!posterImage` check to prevent flash when poster exists

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (0 errors)
- ✅ Video element reuse working correctly
- ✅ Poster images display immediately
- ✅ Navigation state preserved across route changes
- ✅ Fallback chain intact (video → art → gradient)

### Technical Achievement
Canvas videos now properly handle all navigation patterns: direct visits, re-navigation, cross-project navigation, and playlist context preservation. Video element lifecycle management eliminates remounting issues and browser caching problems.

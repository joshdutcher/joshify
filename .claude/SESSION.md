## Current Session - October 14, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **Canvas Poster Image Fix Complete**
**Focus**: Fix canvas video poster image display during initial load

### Session Summary

Fixed the "loading canvas" text appearing instead of poster images during initial video load. Root cause was missing `posterImage` prop in component usage. All 11 poster WebP images exist and are now properly displayed while videos buffer.

### âœ… Completed This Session

**Canvas Poster Image Display Fix**:
- **Problem**: "Loading canvas" text showing instead of poster image on initial video load
- **Root Cause**: `posterImage` prop not passed to `ProjectCanvas` component
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/views/ProjectDetailView.tsx:38` - Added `posterImage={project.canvasPoster}`
  - `src/components/NowPlayingPanel.tsx:42` - Added `posterImage={currentlyPlaying.canvasPoster}`
- **Result**: Poster images display immediately while videos buffer
- **Validation**: TypeScript (0 errors) and ESLint checks pass

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

1. **Poster-to-Video Transition Flash** (Minor UX Issue)
   - Poster image briefly disappears to gray/black before video fades in

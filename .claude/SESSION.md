# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - September 30, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Railway Container Crash Resolution
**Focus**: Canvas Video Deployment → Railway Container Fix

### Session Context
- Joshify portfolio project: Spotify-clone personal portfolio
- Goal: Deploy canvas videos to production and resolve Railway container crashes
- **ACHIEVEMENT**: Canvas videos migrated to CDN, Railway container crash fixed

### Final Status - Railway Deployment Operational

#### ✅ Canvas Video CDN Migration (v1.0.8)
- **Videos Uploaded**: 6 canvas videos (76MB total) to GitHub Releases CDN
- **Projects Updated**: beer-fridge, did-kansas-win, wichitaradar, mobile-api-rebuild, law-firm-startup-operations, startup-technology-infrastructure
- **Strategy**: Videos hosted via GitHub Releases, keeping git repository lean
- **PR #13**: Merged - Canvas video URLs updated from local to CDN

#### ✅ Railway Container Fix (v1.0.11)
- **Root Cause**: Vite attempting to auto-open browser in preview mode
- **Solution**: Added `preview: { open: false }` to vite.config.ts
- **Failed Attempts**:
  - v1.0.10: `--host` flag (didn't prevent browser opening)
  - PR #15: package.json modification approach
- **Successful Fix**: PR #16 - Vite config modification
- **Status**: Railway deployment operational

#### ✅ Technical Achievements
- **CORS Handling**: Enhanced smoke tests to filter expected GitHub CDN CORS errors (PR #14)
- **Container Compatibility**: Resolved xdg-open ENOENT errors in Railway containers
- **Release Workflow**: v1.0.8 → v1.0.9 → v1.0.10 → v1.0.11 iterative debugging
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: All checks passing, Railway automatic deployment working

### Release History This Session

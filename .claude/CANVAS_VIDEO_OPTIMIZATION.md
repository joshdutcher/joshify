# Canvas Video Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

Canvas videos in the Joshify portfolio were experiencing critical performance issues:

**Symptoms**:
- Videos taking 15-40 seconds to load (vs. target <3 seconds)
- Some videos (democracy-engine, election-data-pipeline) not loading at all
- No visual feedback during loading, appearing broken to users
- Poor user experience with long blank screens

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **File Size Issues**: Videos 3-5x larger than optimal
   - beer-fridge.mp4: 3.0MB (works fine, baseline)
   - democracy-engine.mp4: 8.0MB (2.7x larger)
   - election-data-pipeline.mp4: 15MB (5x larger)

2. **No Visual Feedback**: `preload="metadata"` provided no loading indicators

3. **No Instant Visual**: No poster images for immediate user feedback

## Solution Overview

**Multi-Phase Approach**:
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Video file optimization (60-87% size reduction)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Enhanced loading UX (posters, loading states, progress)
- ðŸ”œ **Phase 3**: Performance optimizations (lazy loading, preloading)
- ðŸ”œ **Phase 4**: Monitoring & analytics (load time tracking)

**Target Performance**:
- Video file sizes: <2MB (down from 3-15MB)
- Load times: 2-4 seconds (down from 15-40 seconds)
- Instant visual feedback: <100ms (poster images)
- User experience: Professional loading states with progress indication

## Phase 1: Video Optimization (âœ… Complete)

### Created: `scripts/optimize-canvas-videos.sh`

**Purpose**: Re-encode canvas videos with web-optimized settings

**Optimization Settings**:
```bash
Resolution: 720x1280 (9:16 aspect ratio)
Bitrate: 1.2 Mbps
Frame Rate: 30 fps
Codec: H.264 High Profile, Level 4.1
Preset: slow (better compression)
Format: MP4 with FastStart (streaming-ready)
```

**Expected Results**:
```
beer-fridge.mp4:            3.0MB â†’ 1.2MB  (60% reduction)
democracy-engine.mp4:       8.0MB â†’ 1.8MB  (78% reduction)
election-data-pipeline.mp4: 15MB  â†’ 1.9MB  (87% reduction)
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatic backup of original videos to `public/canvases-backup/`
- Output to `public/canvases-optimized/` for review before replacement
- Preserves 9:16 aspect ratio with intelligent padding
- FastStart flag enables streaming playback
- Audio stripped (videos are visual only)

## Phase 1.5: Poster Image Generation (âœ… Complete)

### Created: `scripts/generate-poster-frames.sh`

**Purpose**: Extract first frame from each video as WebP poster image

**Settings**:
```bash
Format: WebP
Quality: 85
Target Size: 10-30KB per image
Frame: First frame (frame 0)
```

**Output**:
- Directory: `public/canvases/posters/`
- Naming: `{video-name}-poster.webp`
- Examples:
  - democracy-engine-poster.webp (â‰ˆ20KB)
  - election-data-pipeline-poster.webp (â‰ˆ25KB)
  - beer-fridge-poster.webp (â‰ˆ18KB)

**Benefits**:
- Instant visual feedback (<100ms load time)
- Tiny file sizes (10-30KB vs. 1-2MB videos)
- Represents video content accurately
- Zero additional creation work (automated)

**Location**: `/home/josh/www/projects/joshify/scripts/generate-poster-frames.sh`

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Loading UX (âœ… Complete)

### Modified: `src/components/ProjectCanvas.tsx`

**Changes Implemented**:

#### 1. New Props & State
```typescript
// New prop
posterImage?: string | null;

// New state variables
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [loadProgress, setLoadProgress] = useState(0);
```

#### 2. Video Loading Lifecycle Events
```typescript
onLoadStart={handleVideoLoadStart}    // Triggers loading state
onProgress={handleVideoProgress}      // Updates progress bar
onLoadedData={handleVideoLoad}        // Completes loading
onError={handleVideoError}            // Enhanced error logging
```

#### 3. Loading State Management
- Tracks video buffer progress (0-100%)
- Displays loading spinner during initial load
- Shows progress bar with real-time buffering status
- Smooth opacity transition when video ready

#### 4. Visual Feedback Components
**Poster Image**: Shows while video loads or on error
```typescript
{posterImage && (!isLoaded || hasError) && (
    <img src={posterImage} alt="..." className="..." />
)}
```

**Loading Indicator**: Spinner + progress bar + text
```typescript
{isLoading && !isLoaded && !hasError && (
    <div className="...">
        <div className="w-12 h-12 ... animate-spin"></div>
        <div className="w-48 bg-gray-700 ...">
            <div style={{ width: `${loadProgress}%` }} />
        </div>
        <p>Loading canvas...</p>
    </div>
)}
```

#### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error logging with project context
- Video URL HEAD request for accessibility check
- Fallback chain: video â†’ poster â†’ album art â†’ gradient
- Network/Ready state diagnostics

**Location**: `/home/josh/www/projects/joshify/src/components/ProjectCanvas.tsx` (lines 41-289)

---

### Modified: `src/types/index.ts`

**Change**: Added `canvasPoster` field to Project interface

```typescript
export interface Project {
  // ... existing fields ...
  readonly canvas: string | null;
  readonly canvasPoster: string | null; // NEW - Poster image for canvas video
  readonly albumArtBasedOn: string | null;
}
```

**Location**: `/home/josh/www/projects/joshify/src/types/index.ts` (line 114)

---

### Modified: `src/data/projects.ts`

**Changes**:

#### 1. Helper Function
```typescript
const getCanvasPosterUrl = (filename: string | null): string | null => {
    if (!filename) return null;
    const posterName = filename.replace('.mp4', '-poster.webp');
    return `/canvases/posters/${posterName}`;
};
```

#### 2. Updated All 13 Projects with Canvas Videos
Every project with a canvas video now includes:
```typescript
canvas: getCanvasUrl('video-name.mp4'),
canvasPoster: getCanvasPosterUrl('video-name.mp4'), // NEW
```

- Always run the test server on port 3000 and hot reload. Try not to open the site in a new tab every time the server restarts. Do not increment the port number.

## Phase-Based Development Protocol

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When working through multi-phase enhancement projects:

1. **Phase Completion**: At the end of each phase, STOP and ask for user approval before continuing
2. **Documentation Updates**: Before asking to continue, update planning documentation with:
   - Detailed findings and discoveries from the completed phase
   - Current project state and any changes to approach
   - Updated technical specifications or requirements
   - Evidence of completion (screenshots, code changes, analysis results)
3. **User Control**: Never automatically proceed to the next phase without explicit user permission
4. **Planning File Updates**: Update `.claude/PLANNING.md` and `.claude/TASKS.md` with comprehensive phase completion notes

This ensures user oversight and proper documentation of the development process.
